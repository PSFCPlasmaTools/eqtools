    handling class for DIII-D. Pulls EFIT data from selected MDS tree
    and shot, stores as object attributes. Each EFIT variable or set of
    variables is recovered with a corresponding getter method. Essential data
    for EFIT mapping are pulled on initialization (e.g. psirz grid). Additional
    data are pulled at the first request and stored for subsequent usage.
    
    Intializes DIII-D version of EFITTree object.  Pulls data from MDS tree for 
    storage in instance attributes.  Core attributes are populated from the MDS 
    tree on initialization.  Additional attributes are initialized as None, 
    filled on the first request to the object.

    Args:
        shot (integer): DIII-D shot index.
    
    Keyword Args:
        tree (string): Optional input for EFIT tree, defaults to 'EFIT01'
            (i.e., EFIT data are under \\EFIT01::top.results).
        length_unit (string): Sets the base unit used for any quantity whose
            dimensions are length to any power. Valid options are:
                
                ===========  ===========================================================================================
                'm'          meters
                'cm'         centimeters
                'mm'         millimeters
                'in'         inches
                'ft'         feet
                'yd'         yards
                'smoot'      smoots
                'cubit'      cubits
                'hand'       hands
                'default'    whatever the default in the tree is (no conversion is performed, units may be inconsistent)
                ===========  ===========================================================================================
                
            Default is 'm' (all units taken and returned in meters).
        gfile (string): Optional input for EFIT geqdsk location name, 
            defaults to 'geqdsk' (i.e., EFIT data are under
            \\tree::top.results.GEQDSK)
        afile (string): Optional input for EFIT aeqdsk location name,
            defaults to 'aeqdsk' (i.e., EFIT data are under 
            \\tree::top.results.AEQDSK)
        tspline (Boolean): Sets whether or not interpolation in time is
            performed using a tricubic spline or nearest-neighbor
            interpolation. Tricubic spline interpolation requires at least
            four complete equilibria at different times. It is also assumed
            that they are functionally correlated, and that parameters do
            not vary out of their boundaries (derivative = 0 boundary
            condition). Default is False (use nearest neighbor interpolation).
        monotonic (Boolean): Sets whether or not the "monotonic" form of time
            window finding is used. If True, the timebase must be monotonically
            increasing. Default is False (use slower, safer method).
